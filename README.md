# Calculator-in-Visual-Basic
This is a very easy to use, clean, portable calculator made in Visual Basic. You can take this anywhere you go, even on your flash-drive! You can transfer
this folder into any device and run the .exe application. (It must be inside the folder because there are application files in the folder. Thanks for
downloading my calculator!
